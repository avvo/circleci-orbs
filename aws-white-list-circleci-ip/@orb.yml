  Add a custom script that gets the public ip address of the current box 
  and calls the AWS CLI to add an inbound security rule on the fly. 
  Then remove that rule at the end of the script.

  This version is based on the configure/aws-white-list-circleci-ip@1.0.1
  orb with changes/bug fixes.

  * Support for specifying $IP environment variable. (Useful when the
    IP you are registering is a CircleCI remote docker engine, not
    the CircleCI container on which the orb is invoked.)
  * Uses api.ipify.org rather than checkip.amazon.com to determine default
    value of IP address. Just in case the CircleCI environment runs
    somewhere other than Amazon.
